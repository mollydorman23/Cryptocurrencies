# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an analysis for a company that is preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies and they’ve asked us to create a report that includes which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data in its initial state is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Accountability Accounting is looking for, we’ve decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We’ve also created data visualizations to share our findings.
